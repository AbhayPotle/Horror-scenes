> *"This place smells like dust and something rotten..."*

A **hybrid web-horror experience** that pushes the boundaries of browser-based immersion. This project abandons heavy video assets in favor of a **code-driven engine** that generates Fear in real-time using procedural audio, synthesized acting, and cinematic CSS visuals.

## 💀 Project Overview

This is not just a website; it is a **Paramount-quality horror simulation** running entirely in the browser.

### Key Features
*   **🔊 Procedural Audio Engine**: No pre-recorded MP3s. Background drones, floor creaks, and door slams are generated *mathematically* in real-time using the **Web Audio API**.
*   **🗣️ Emotional Speech Synthesis**: A custom `VoiceEngine` that manipulates browser TTS (Text-to-Speech) to whisper, scream, and tremble with fear.
*   **🎥 Cinematic CSS Visuals**: "Ken Burns" camera movements, film grain, and dynamic lighting implemented purely with CSS3 optimizations.
*   **🧠 Neural Canvas**: A dynamic canvas layer that mimics "glitches" and "paranormal signal intrusions" using pixel manipulation.

## 🤖 Technology Stack

This project was architected and implemented using **Antigravity AI**, following the **"Vibe Coding"** methodology (Flow-state, iteration-heavy development).

| Component | Technology Used | Description |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Core Logic** | `JavaScript (ES6+)` | Async/Await event loop for timing scenes. |
| **Audio** | `Web Audio API` | Oscillators & Gain Nodes for sound effects. |
| **Acting** | `SpeechSynthesis API` | Pitch/Rate manipulation for emotion. |
| **Visuals** | `CSS3 / Hardware Accel` | 3D Transforms, Filters, Blend Modes. |
| **Assets** | `Generative AI` | 3D-assisted environmental renders. |

## 🕹️ Episode 1: The House That Breathes

The current build features the pilot episode:
1.  **The Arrival**: A family enters a dusty, abandoned farmhouse.
2.  **The Scent**: The mother notices a rotting smell that shouldn't be there.
3.  **The Signal**: An unknown entity interrupts the broadcast frequency.
4.  **The Jumpscare**: A procedurally triggered climax.

## 🚀 How to Run

1.  **Clone the Repository**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/AbhayPotle/Horror-scenes.git
    ```
2.  **Open locally**
    Simply open `index.html` in any modern browser (Chrome/Edge recommended for best Speech Synthesis support).
    *No Node.js or backend required—it is a pure client-side experience.*
