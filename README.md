## �️ THE EXPERIENCE

**This is not just a website. It is a haunting.**

*The House That Breathes* abandons the safety of pre-recorded video files. Instead, it is a **living, code-driven nightmare** that constructs terror mathematically in real-time.

Every creak of the floorboards, every flicker of the shadows, and every whispered threat is generated **procedurally** by the engine at the exact moment you experience it. No two hauntings are ever the same.

## 🩸 ANATOMY OF FEAR

### 🔊 Binaural Auditory Hallucinations
**Don't trust your ears.** The engine doesn't play MP3s. It synthesizes raw audio waves to mimic the frequency of dread.
*   **Dynamic Soundscapes**: Industrial drones and infrasound frequencies that vibrate the very bones of the browser.
*   **Spatial Audio**: Whispers that move behind your head. Footsteps that stop right when you listen for them.

### 🎥 Retinal Burn (Zero-Asset Visuals)
**Your screen is the medium.** The visuals are rendered natively using advanced CSS3, creating a "found footage" aesthetic that feels uncomfortably real.
*   **The Neural Canvas**: A digital membrane that glitches, tears, and bleeds as the entity approaches.
*   **Ken Burns Anxiety**: The camera doesn't just pan; it *searches*. Calculated movements that mimic a trembling hand holding a camera.

### 🗣️ The Voice in the Machine
**It speaks to you.** A custom `VoiceEngine` hijacks the browser's speech synthesis to deliver dialogue that trembles, screams, and breaks. This is not a recording. It is the machine screaming in real-time.

## � SYSTEM ACCESS

### ⚠️ Prerequisite
**Courage.** (And a modern browser. Chrome recommended for full binaural support).

### 🔓 Initiation Protocol
1.  **Clone the Signal**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/AbhayPotle/Horror-scenes.git
    cd Horror-scenes
    ```
2.  **Establish Connection**
    Open `index.html`. Put on headphones. Turn off the lights.
    *Do not look behind you.*

## � EPISODE 1: THE ARRIVAL
**Subject: The Farmhouse**
1.  **The Scent**: The digital air grows heavy.
2.  **The Signal**: A frequency that shouldn't exist interrupts the feed.
3.  **The Manifestation**: The engine decides it has seen enough of you.
